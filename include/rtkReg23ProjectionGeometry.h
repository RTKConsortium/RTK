/** \class Reg23ProjectionGeometry
 * \brief {A simple utility class which makes the REG23 projection geometry
 * compatible with RTK's geometry.}
 *
 * REG23 geometry (open-radART, plastimatch) is very simplicistic: a perspective
 * projection is defined by a source position (S) in world coordinate system
 * (WCS), a detector position (R) in WCS and the detector orientation in WCS
 * by the detector row vector (r) and the detector column vector (c).
 *
 * In order to make RTK aware of this geometry, the parameters mentioned above
 * have to be brought into RTK's native geometry format. This is achieved by
 * deriving from RTK's circular 3D projection geometry class and adding a new
 * dedicated method for adding a REG23 projection. Internally, this method
 * converts the S,R,r,c set into Euler angles and offsets as required by RTK's
 * native projection geometry definition format.
 *
 * @warning {The detector offset and direction is fully modeled by the resultant
 * RTK geometry entry. This means that the projection stack input into back-
 * projection filters or forward-projectors is expected to have zero-origin and
 * identity-direction!}
 *
 * @see rtk::ThreeDCircularProjectionGeometry
 *
 * \test {TestReg23ProjectionGeometry.cxx}
