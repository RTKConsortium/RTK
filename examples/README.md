C++ / Python examples
========

This section provides a collection of C++ and Python code examples 
to demonstrate how to effectively use RTK in various applications.

A key example is [FirstReconstruction](./FirstReconstruction/README.md), 
a generic starting point for users new to RTK. This example demonstrates 
the fundamental steps of performing a reconstruction, making it an ideal 
entry point for those beginning with RTK.
It showcases how to set up an RTK pipeline, configure parameters, 
and execute a basic reconstruction process.

Additionally, there are examples which use CUDA for GPU-accelerated computations, 
providing efficient implementations for high-performance applications.
