Command-line examples
========

RTK provides command line applications that can be built from the C++ code by turning `ON` the `RTK_BUILD_APPLICATIONS` CMake option. A few of these applications have also been translated to Python and integrated in the [Pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/itk-rtk/). The options of each command line application can be listed with the `--help option`.
