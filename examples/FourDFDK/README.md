#   4D FDK

FourDFDK shows how to perform analytical cone-beam CT reconstruction using either CPU or GPU resources.
Only the [FDKBackProjection](https://www.openrtk.org/Doxygen/classrtk_1_1FDKBackProjectionImageFilter.html) and [CudaFDKBackProjection](https://www.openrtk.org/Doxygen/classrtk_1_1CudaFDKBackProjectionImageFilter.html) projectors can be used for back projection, depending on the `RTK_USE_CUDA` CMake variable.

This example reads its data from disk in `your_rtk_build_folder/test/`. The data is generated by the example [GenerateFourDData](../GenerateFourDData/README.md). Therefore, you must run GenerateFourDData at least once before you run this example.
Alternatively, you can also [download the data on Girder](https://data.kitware.com/#collection/5a7706878d777f0649e04776/folder/69611c373b9bcc32c3188531).
