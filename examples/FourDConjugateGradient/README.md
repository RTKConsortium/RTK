#   4D Conjugate Gradient

FourDConjugateGradient shows how to perform iterative cone-beam CT reconstruction using either CPU or GPU resources.
You can refer to the [projectors documentation](../../documentation/docs/Projectors.md) to see all options available for the back and forwardprojections.

This example reads its data from disk in `your_rtk_build_folder/test/`. The data is generated by the example [GenerateFourDData](../GenerateFourDData/README.md). Therefore, you must run GenerateFourDData at least once before you run this example.
Alternatively, you can also [download the data on Girder](https://data.kitware.com/#collection/5a7706878d777f0649e04776/folder/69611c373b9bcc32c3188531).
