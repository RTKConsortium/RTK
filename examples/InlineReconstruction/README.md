# Inline Reconstruction

InlineReconstruction demonstrates how to perform cone-beam CT reconstruction using
RTK's implementation of [FDK](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.1.000612) while
projections are being acquired.

The program simulates the acquisition of X-ray projections in a separate thread,  
gradually reconstructing the 3D volume as new projections become available.
