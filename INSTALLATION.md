RTK installation
================

Configuration, compilation and installation with ITK
----------------------------------------------------
RTK is a module of [ITK](https://www.itk.org), the Insight Toolkit. Follow the instructions of the [ITK software guide](https://itk.org/ITKSoftwareGuide/html) ([chapter 2](https://itk.org/ITKSoftwareGuide/html/Book1/ITKSoftwareGuide-Book1ch2.html) mainly) for configuring and compiling ITK. The following CMake options are RTK specific:

* `Module_RTK`: Activates RTK download and compilation. Default is `OFF`. Turn it `ON` to activate RTK or compile RTK independently (see below).
* `Module_RTK_GIT_TAG`: Git tag for the RTK download. By default, the RTK version which is downloaded and compiled is the one given in the [RTK.remote.cmake](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/blob/master/Modules/Remote/RTK.remote.cmake). Change this option to build another version. For example, you can change it to `master` to build the latest RTK version. RTK is only maintained to be backward compatible with the latest ITK release and ITK master branch.
* `RTK_BUILD_APPLICATIONS`: Activates the compilation of RTK's command line tools. Although RTK is mainly a toolkit, we also provide several command line tools for doing most of the available processing. These command line tools use [gengetopt](https://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html). Several examples are available on the [Applications](https://wiki.openrtk.org/index.php/RTK_wiki_help#Applications) section of the [wiki](http://wikiopenrtk.org).
* `RTK_USE_CUDA`: Activates CUDA computation. Default is `ON` if CMake has automatically found the CUDA package and a CUDA-compatible GPU, and `OFF` otherwise.
* `RTK_CUDA_VERSION`: Specifies an exact version of the CUDA toolkit which must be used. If unspecified, RTK only checks if the found version is recent enough.
* `RTK_CUDA_PROJECTIONS_SLAB_SIZE`: Set the number of projections processed at once in CUDA processing. Default is 16.
* `RTK_PROBE_EACH_FILTER`: Activates the timing, CPU and CUDA memory consumption of each filter. Defaults is `OFF`. When activated, each filter processing is probed and a summary can be displayed. All command line applications display the result with `--verbose`.

RTK will automatically be installed when installing ITK.

Independent configuration and compilation
-----------------------------------------
For RTK developpers, it may be useful to compile RTK independently from ITK. This is possible, simply:
* Compile ITK with `Module_RTK=OFF`.
* If you want to use CUDA, also activate `Module_CudaCommon` or compile it separately as RTK in the following two bullet points (cloning its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RTKConsortium/ITKCudaCommon) or downloading it as a [zip package](https://codeload.github.com/RTKConsortium/ITKCudaCommon/zip/master)).
* Manually download RTK's source repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/RTKConsortium/RTK) with `git` (recommended) or as a [zip package](https://codeload.github.com/RTKConsortium/RTK/zip/master).
* Configure the project with CMake pointing to RTK's source directory and setting the CMake option `ITK_DIR` to ITK's compilation directory. All CMake options above can be set except `Module_RTK`.

Installation is currently not supported for independent RTK compilations.

Pre-compiled binaries
---------------------
We only provide pre-compiled binaries for the Python package which depends on ITK. Use the following commands to install the RTK module with `pip`.
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install itk-rtk
```
The same operating systems and Python versions are supported as ITK's packages, see the list on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/itk-rtk).

We also provide pre-compiled [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) packages for Windows and Linux. They require an installed version of CUDA 11.6. Use the following command instead of the above one to install the CUDA RTK module with `pip`.
```
python -m pip install itk-rtk-cuda116
```

Getting started
---------------
See [GettingStarted.md](GettingStarted.md). Your `CMakeLists.txt` can now use RTK when importing ITK as shown in the [FirstReconstruction's CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/RTKConsortium/RTK/blob/master/examples/FirstReconstruction/CMakeLists.txt#L7).
