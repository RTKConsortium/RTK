<span style="font-weight: bold;">There are basically 3 versions of the script.
  See below for details.<br>
<br>
NOTE: The source code is hosted at a new svn server (but the old
 code.sci.utah.edu server name should alias to the new one) : </span><a

 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><br> This web page contains information about an unofficial version of
the FindCuda.cmake script developed to compile CUDA
programs.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> Many individuals have adopted
the script and suggested improvements, and tested the script on various
platforms and configurations.  We appreciate all of the feedback and bug fixes
we have received since the initial release.<br>
<p>This webpage is updated infrequently- the svn log contains details
about bug fixes and updates.</p>
<p>Please send any comments or questions by email. If you use the
NVIDIA forums, we might not see you question for some time.</p>

<!--  *************************************** -->
<h3>Trunk</h3>
<p>Again many changes have come been implemented.  Some of the changes have been
  done in preparation of the code moving into the CMake distribution.  The trunk
  is in a state of flux, but should work barring any unknown bugs.</p>

<p><b>It is necessary to make several
changes to a project's CMakeLists.txt files in order to use the new
version.</b></p>

<p>Get the code
  <blockquote><pre>
svn co https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/findcuda/trunk FindCUDA
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Changes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Variable name changes
  <ul><tt>
    <li>CUDA_NVCC -> CUDA_NVCC_EXECUTABLE</li>
    <li>CUDA_INSTALL_PREFIX -> CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR</li>
    <li>CUFFT_LIBRARIES -> CUDA_CUFFT_LIBRARIES</li>

    <li>FOUND_CUDA_NVCC_INCLUDE -> CUDA_TOOLKIT_INCLUDE</li>
    <li>FOUND_CUDART -> CUDA_CUDART_LIBRARY</li>
    <li>FOUND_CUDA -> CUDA_CUDA_LIBRARY</li>

    <li>FOUND_CUT_INCLUDE -> CUDA_CUT_INCLUDE_DIR</li>
    <li>CUDA_CUT_INCLUDE_DIRS -> CUDA_CUT_INCLUDE_DIR</li>
    <li>FOUND_CUT -> CUDA_CUT_LIBRARY</li>
    <li>CUDA_CUT_LIBRARIES -> CUDA_CUT_LIBRARY</li>

    <li>FOUND_cufft -> CUDA_cufft_LIBRARY</li>
    <li>FOUND_cublas -> CUDA_cublas_LIBRARY</li>
  </ul></tt></li>
  <li>API Changes
  <ul>
    <li>The script now supports checking of the CUDA version using the standard
      found in <tt>find_package()</tt>.</li>
    <li><tt>CUDA_COMPILE_PTX</tt> removes the second argument that held the list
       of source files to match CUDA_COMPILE.</li>
    <li>If you were using it before <tt>CUDA_add_custom_commands</tt> has been
      renamed to <tt>CUDA_WRAP_SRCS</tt> and its API has changed.  See docs in
      FindCUDA.cmake.  This function is now blessed to be used outside of the
      script.</li>
    <li>You can now specify extra options to pass into nvcc with the OPTIONS
      flag to <tt>CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE</tt>, <tt>CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY</tt>,
      <tt>CUDA_COMPILE</tt>, <tt>CUDA_COMPILE_PTX</tt>, and
      <tt>CUDA_WRAP_SRCS</tt>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>include_directories(${CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS}) is now called for you in
  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.</li>
  <li>Changed CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN default to OFF.</li>
  <li>Object files are now generated instead of C files.  This will generate
  different code for different build types.</li>
  <li>Compiler definitions (via <tt>add_definitions()</tt>) are automatically
  added to the host code compilation.</li>
  <li>CMAKE_C_FLAGS and friends are also automatically added to the host code
  compilation.</li>
  <li>Minimum CMake version 2.6.2 is required.</li>
  <li>Build rules are now attached to the source files by
  default.  <tt>CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE</tt> was off by default
  in the last version.  If you want to add the same cuda file to more that one
  target, you should turn this off.</li>
  <li><tt>CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR</tt> can now be specified.  If not
  specified (i.e. it is blank), then the <tt>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</tt> is
  used.</li>
  <li>If you want to build a shared library then you should specify this via the
  CMake variable <tt>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<!--  *************************************** -->
<h3>2.0</h3>
<p>We released a major revision to the script in December 2008 at
approximately the same time as the CUDA 2.1 beta. There are many
differences in the new version of the script and it has been tested
extensively on Linux, Mac, and WinXP/Vista.</p>

<p><b>It is necessary to make several
changes to a project's CMakeLists.txt files in order to use the new
version.</b></p>

<p>The code is available in an svn repository:
<blockquote><pre>
svn co https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/findcuda/tags/2.0 FindCUDA
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<h4>List of partial changes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The capitalization of the script's filename is changed to
FindCUDA.cmake.</li>
  <li>The script may be included using FIND_PACKAGE (see example code).</li>
  <li>Switched to standard CMake package variable names: (e.g. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS</span> instead of
CUDA_INCLUDE,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> CUDA_LIBRARIES</span>
instead of CUDA_TARGET_LINK).</li>
  <li>Selection of Device or Release mode via boolean option <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION</span> instead
of a text string.</li>
  <li>Paths added to INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES are passed to nvcc.</li>
  <li>Added option to host compilation mode boolean option.</li>
  <li>Added CUDA_COMPILE_PTX macro for compilation to .ptx.</li>
  <li>Added a macro generated target to clean all generated
dependencies.</li>
  <li>Locates the cuFFT and cuBLAS libraries as well (both in Device
and Emulation mode).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Major bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed problem in Emulation mode which caused targets to
continuously be rebuilt.</li>
  <li>Fixed problems associated with incomplete compilation in visual
studio.</li>
  <li>Updated default paths for toolkit and SDK on several platforms.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set the cmake cache variable <span style="font-weight: bold;">CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN</span>
to enable or disable generation and parsing of .cubin files for kernels
in Device mode. When enabled the number of registers, memory usage,
etc. will be printed to the console for each kernel. This information
can be entered in the <a
 href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda.html#downloads">Cuda
occupancy calculator</a>. </li>
  <li>The script will output the actual command lines used in verbose
mode (e.g. make VERBOSE=1).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The example code is intended to demonstrate cmake script usage
only, the .cu files don't do anything illustrative.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<!--  *************************************** -->
<h3>1.0</h3>
You can get the original version of the script by doing
<blockquote></pre>
svn co https://code.sci.utah.edu/svn/findcuda/tags/1.0 FindCUDA
</pre></blockquote>
<br>





<h2>Usage:</h2>
The script will search for your cuda toolkit and SDK installation using
several standard paths and the
environment variables which are created by the installer. <br>
<br>
The following example includes the script and shows how to add code in
an executable. The CUDA_ADD_* commands have the same
semantics as the standard ADD_* commands.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><pre>
SET(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/cuda" ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH})
FIND_PACKAGE(CUDA)

CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE(test
  test_bin.cu
  main.cc
  )
</pre></blockquote>
<br>
See additional usage in the example project.<br>
