Welcome to the Reconstruction Toolkit (RTK)
===========================================

Here are suggested steps for the RTK beginner.

  1. Install the software following [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

  2. If you are not already familiar with ITK, [get started with ITK](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/blob/master/GettingStarted.md).

  3. Check out the [FirstReconstruction](https://github.com/RTKConsortium/RTK/blob/master/examples/FirstReconstruction) example (both the [CMake](https://github.com/RTKConsortium/RTK/blob/master/examples/FirstReconstruction/CMakeLists.txt) and the [C++](https://github.com/RTKConsortium/RTK/blob/master/examples/FirstReconstruction/FirstReconstruction.cxx) codes). Many other examples are in the [documentation](https://docs.openrtk.org/) using the applications (corresponding source code in the [applications subdirectory](https://github.com/RTKConsortium/RTK/blob/master/applications)).

  4. Ask question to the [user mailing list](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/mailman/listinfo/rtk-users).
